# Model analysis project

Our project is titled *PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION* and is about the Ben-Porath model from 1967. The model has a representative agent living two periods and choosing the amount of time invested in education each period. The agent can study or work, and study generates returns in the wage from working, but it is also costly. How does the person invest his time?

The *results* of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

*Dependencies:* Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
