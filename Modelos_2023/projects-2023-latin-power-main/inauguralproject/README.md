# Inaugural project

# **New version date: 03 April / 2023**


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject_bis.ipynb](inauguralproject_bis.ipynb).

The notebook and code are separated in the following items:

Question 1: This point has a double loop to calculate the utility for each possible combination of alpha and sigma. The utility is calculated calling the solve_discrete function. The results are discrete and presented in a table format.

Question 2: This point has a loop to calculate the utility for each value of female wage, the creation of a dataframe and a graph of the Logarithm of the ratio of wages (Female/Male) and the Logarithm of the ratio of Hours in home production (Female/Male).

Question 3: This point has a loop to calculate the utility for each value of female wage. The utility is calculated calling the solve_continously function. The results are continuous and presented in a graph of the ratio of wages (Female/Male) and the Logarithm of the ratio of Hours in home production (Female/Male).

Question 4: This point defines a function that finds alpha and sigma such that it minimizes the sum of squared residuals. The method used is “Nelder-Mead”.

Question 5: We include a estigma parameter which represents discrimination.


Dependencies: Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
