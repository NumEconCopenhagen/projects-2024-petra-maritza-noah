# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION: Model Becker-Tomes without credit constraints (1986)** and is about the Becker-Tomes model, which focuses on parents'investment decisions with regards to childrens'education. In our analysis we decided to focus on the model without credit constraints, meaning that parents can borrow as much as they want, with children having to repay the debt in the future adding at the interest matured on it.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the installation of  numpy matplotlib pandas scipy sympy plotly ipywidgets ipympl packages.
