# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Understanding Socioeconomic Dynamics: Exploring Relative Poverty, Negative Net Wealth, and Net Wealth Trends** and is about the analysis of relative poverty and various form of wealth (positive and negative) in Denmark.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. negative_net_wealth.xlsx (*Denmark statistics*) 
1. net_wealth.xlsx (*Denmark statistics*)
1. relative_poverty.xslx (*Denmark statistics*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
